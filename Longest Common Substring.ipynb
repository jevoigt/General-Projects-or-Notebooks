    "## For this assignment we will write a dynamic program that will return the longest common substring between two strings. Dynamic programming helps us optimize the process that without dynamic programming, would lead to a much less efficient time complexity, because we would have to esentially find all of the substrings within each string and find the longest that is found in both. We can get these results in a more efficent manner in a dynamic way."
