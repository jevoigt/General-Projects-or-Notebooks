# General Projects or Notebooks

Misc Python notebooks / scripts that have been written for recreation or general work and interests.

Much of this code was not originally intended to be provided for and/or used by anyone but myself or a professor, so please excuse any apparent lack of readability within chunks of code, or possible work flow confusions. The restructuring of my files is a work in progress to improve my work so it can become more interpretable to anyone who would like to view these files. The inclusion of other files and projects is ongoing.
